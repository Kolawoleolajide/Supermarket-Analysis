📊 Supermarket Sales Analysis — Postgre SQL + Power BI

This project analyzes supermarket sales data to uncover insights across product performance, profitability, and operational efficiency.
The analysis was carried out using PostgreSQL (pgAdmin4) for data cleaning, transformation, and SQL-based insight generation, while Power BI was used to build an interactive and visually compelling dashboard.

🎯 Objectives

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of SQL and Power BI to solve real business problems related to:
	•	Product performance
	•	Profitability
	•	Operational efficiency

🔧 Tools & Technologies
	•	PostgreSQL (pgAdmin4) – Data cleaning, SQL queries, insight generation
	•	Power BI – Dashboard design, DAX measures, data modeling
	•	Excel – Initial dataset formatting

🧠 Problem Statements & Key Insights

🔵 1. Product Performance

Goal: Identify which product lines drive revenue and which ones underperform.

🔍 Key Insights
	•	Food & Beverages generated the highest sales ($58K), making it the best-performing product line.
	•	Health & Beauty recorded the lowest sales, indicating weak demand.
	•	Profitability varies by branch:
	•	Branch A: Home & Lifestyle is most profitable
	•	Branch B: Health & Beauty and Sports & Travel perform best
	•	Branch C: Fashion Accessories and Food & Beverages lead
	•	Food & Beverages also received the highest customer ratings, showing strong customer satisfaction.

✔ Recommendation

Increase marketing, inventory planning, and promotional focus on Food & Beverages, while re-evaluating pricing, placement, and promotions for weaker categories like Health & Beauty.
Apply branch-specific product strategies based on local profitability trends.

🟣 2. Profitability

Goal: Understand how tax, COGS, and gross margin influence profit across branches.

🔍 Key Insights
	•	All branches show a uniform gross margin of 16.6%, likely because the dataset covers only 3 months.
	•	Food & Beverages contributes the most to overall profit and revenue.
	•	Branch C is the top-performing branch, generating 34.2% of total profit.

✔ Recommendation

Adopt branch-level pricing and cost optimization strategies, using Branch C’s performance as a benchmark to improve profitability in other locations.

🟠 3. Operational Efficiency

Goal: Identify peak sales periods to improve scheduling and customer service.

🔍 Key Insights
	•	7:00 PM is the peak hour for sales, recording $39,697.
	•	Saturday is the busiest day with 56,118 transactions.

✔ Recommendation

Optimize staff scheduling and inventory stocking around 19:00 hours and Saturdays to enhance customer service and reduce operational pressure during peak periods.
